            <h2>What is a study space?</h2>
            <p>Study spaces are quiet places around campus available to students for study, collaborative work, and more.</p>
            <p>Despite the name, study spaces are not just for studying. Whether you need a space to take a remote course, a room to get some group work done, or even just a place to take a breather between classes, study spaces have you covered.</p>
